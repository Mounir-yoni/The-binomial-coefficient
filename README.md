Binomial Coefficient Calculator
Overview
This C program computes the binomial coefficient 
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
C(n,k) using recursion. The binomial coefficient, also known as "n choose k" or combinations, is a key concept in combinatorics that calculates how many ways you can choose 
𝑘
k items from a set of 
𝑛
n items.

The formula for the binomial coefficient is:

𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
=
𝑛
!
𝑘
!
(
𝑛
−
𝑘
)
!
C(n,k)= 
k!(n−k)!
n!
​
 
This program uses a recursive approach to calculate 
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
C(n,k) without explicitly calculating factorials.

Features
Calculates the binomial coefficient 
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
C(n,k).
Uses a recursive method based on Pascal's Triangle:
𝐶
(
𝑛
,
𝑘
)
=
𝐶
(
𝑛
−
1
,
𝑘
−
1
)
+
𝐶
(
𝑛
−
1
,
𝑘
)
C(n,k)=C(n−1,k−1)+C(n−1,k)
Handles base cases where 
𝑛
=
𝑘
n=k or 
𝑘
=
0
k=0, returning 1 as per the combinatorial identity.
Prerequisites
You will need a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run this program.
